                <p class="prelude-text">The word "chemical" can sound alarming, but it's important to remember that everything is made of chemicals—including water (H₂O) and the air we breathe (N₂, O₂). This page highlights some of the specific man-made and natural compounds in common products, explaining their purpose and why awareness is key.</p>

                        <p class="info">A classic synthetic detergent bar, not a true soap, that uses harsh surfactants which strip the skin of its natural, protective oils.</p>
                        <p class="info">Its "advanced germ protection" relies on potent synthetic antibacterial agents that can disrupt the skin's healthy microbiome.</p>
                        <p class="info">The formula is very drying and can lead to skin irritation and a feeling of tightness after a bath.</p>

                        <p class="info">Marketed as an antiseptic bar, it uses strong synthetic antibacterial and antimicrobial chemicals that are harsh on the skin.</p>
                        <p class="info">The high level of detergents and antiseptic agents can be extremely drying and may trigger skin conditions like eczema.</p>
                        <p class="info">Its formula is designed to kill all germs, including the beneficial bacteria that are essential for healthy skin.</p>

                        <p class="info">Relies on a powerful, complex synthetic "Parfum" for its signature scent, which can contain hidden allergens and phthalates.</p>
                        <p class="info">The base is a standard syndet bar that cleans by stripping away natural oils, rather than gently cleansing.</p>
                        <p class="info">Focuses on a sensory experience (fragrance and lather) rather than nourishing or protecting the skin's health.</p>

                        <p class="info">Marketed as gentle, but it is a synthetic detergent bar, not a natural soap. Its main cleanser is Sodium Lauroyl Isethionate, not saponified oils.</p>
                        <p class="info">While milder than other syndets, it still contains synthetic fragrances and preservatives to achieve its texture and scent.</p>
                        <p class="info">It's a prime example of "hidden chemistry," as its "milder than soap" claim is based on it being a pH-balanced detergent, not a truly natural product.</p>

                        <p class="info">Its iconic strong, "fresh" scent comes from a powerful synthetic fragrance compound.</p>
                        <p class="info">The combination of its deodorant chemicals and stripping detergents can be very harsh and drying, especially for sensitive skin.</p>
