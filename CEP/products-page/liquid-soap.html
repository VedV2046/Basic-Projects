                <p class="prelude-text">The word "chemical" can sound alarming, but it's important to remember that everything is made of chemicals—including water (H₂O) and the air we breathe (N₂, O₂). This page highlights some of the specific man-made and natural compounds in common products, explaining their purpose and why awareness is key.</p>

                        <p class="info">Contains Sodium Laureth Sulfate (SLES), a harsh detergent that can strip the skin's protective moisture barrier.</p>
                        <p class="info">Contains strong synthetic fragrances and artificial colours which serve no cleaning purpose but add to the chemical load.</p>

                        <p class="info">Uses SLES as its primary grease-cutting agent, a chemical known to irritate skin after repeated exposure.</p>
                        <p class="info">Is scented with artificial "Parfum," that can legally hide dozens of chemicals, including potential allergens and hormone-disrupting phthalates.</p>
                        <p class="info">The formula is designed for aggressive cleaning, which can strip the natural oils (sebum) from your hands, leaving them feeling tight and dry.</p>

                        <p class="info">Has sulfate-based formula for its cleaning action, which is effective but can be harsh and irritating to the skin.</p>
                        <p class="info">Gets its bright colour and strong, lingering smell from petroleum-derived synthetic dyes and perfumes, which lack the benefits of natural alternatives.</p>
                        <p class="info">The overall risk comes from its reliance on multiple industrial chemicals, increasing the chances of skin irritation for the person washing the dishes</p>

                        <p class="info">Uses other synthetic additives and preservatives to achieve the desired foam, stability, and fragrance, making it chemically similar to other soaps.</p>
                        <p class="info">This formulation can be misleading for consumers who specifically choose the brand expecting a product free from such common industrial detergents.</p>

                        <p class="info">Contains bright artificial dyes (like Tartrazine or Sunset Yellow) which are purely cosmetic and can be a source of skin sensitivity and allergies.</p>
                        <p class="info">The combination of a powerful detergent base with synthetic additives makes it a high-potential trigger for allergic reactions and skin irritation.</p>
